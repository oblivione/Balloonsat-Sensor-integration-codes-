----counts_to_update_GPS_DATA  // compare to greater thn 2


----watchdow window > 2 times

----print to println for packet data


---fill return withh true or false at else conditions in getGPSdata method ---> Very very important


---compare millis() with unsigned long not unsigned int // Very very important for stability

---initialise GPS_DTA_RAW and GPS_DATA and counts_to_update_GPS_DATA and all things to innitialize at the top of BSsendPacket

-- Add CRLF to GPS_DATA_RAW 


--- error handling in IMUsensor1() and IMUsensor2()
	// error was not handled as IMU() was being called 
	//before if(detectimusensors()==4) and before was 
	// only checking whether to send 		//StringsIMUsensor1/IMUsensor2 or to send error while 
//actually the problem was IMU() will hang if SD/SCL cables are removed and this checking done in  if(detectimusensors()==4)
which actually followed IMU() instead of being called before 
IMU() was called --> now corrected .
